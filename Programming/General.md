## Code Convetions
- Avoid magic numbers
- Avoid deep nesting ifs
- You should always write your code as if comments didn’t exist
- Avoid Large Functions
- Repeated code means a code block that is repeated in your code more than once. This means your code portion needs to be extracted into a function
- Variable Naming and Meaningful Names. Favor Descriptive Over Concise. Avoid One-Letter Variable Names
- Use Consistent Verbs per Concept. This is one of the important naming conventions. If we need a CRUD function, we use create, get, or update with the name.
- Use Nouns for Class Name & Use Pascal Case
- Capitalize Constant Values (SNAKE UPPER CASE)
